Originally when we ran the PIT mutation tests, we had a line coverage of 100%, a mutation coverage of 89% and a test strength of 89% as well. After updating the tests we were able get an increase of 4% for our mutation coverage. So after updating the tests we got a line coverage of 100%, a mutation coverage of 93% and a test strength of 93% as well.
# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
